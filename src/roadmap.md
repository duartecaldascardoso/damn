## Damn Roadmap

My idea is that damn is a flexible and easy to use tool which is fast. To achieve this, these features should exist:

- List existing commands in the history (visibility)
- Remove all existing commands from the history (performance and maintainability)
- Remove selected command from the history (performance, maintainability and cleaning your tracks)
- Version checking 
- Help text 
- Rename the damn keyword into other (personalization, fun, customization)

With those features ready, the user can already relly on the tool. 

Ideas:

- Pair the tool well with existing solutions such as thefuck
- Collect usage statistics related to the history to present some metrics (if user wants it)

  - Most used commands and number of times it has been used
  - Commands that were mistakenly input the most
  - Saved time metric while using Damn (based on estimated input time per word)
